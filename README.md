# PFE-project : Anomalies detection and visualisation

In order to maintain its customers, the bank must, before even offering them services, 
protect them from any potential threat. This can only be done by understanding their "normal" behavior.
The bank must have an omniscient vision of the different transactional patterns of its
customers. It must ensure the "normality" of any transactional event and therefore be
able to detect any anomaly, i.e. any rare and unusual occurrence in the data.
Several constraints emanate from the detection of anomalies. The banking sector is
experiencing a strong increase in the volume of transactional data, which makes them
difficult to exploit. In addition, "machine learning" tools do not seem effective in detecting
anomalies because they generate “false positives” that involve professionals and cost
a lot of money in vain. They can also generate “false negatives” which produce financial
damage for the bank and affect the safety of its customers.
An anomaly can be a fraud, an error in entering customer information, or a path not
frequently taken by a customer (which can be trend, geographic or relational) ... So, the
first step to begin with is to define these anomalies.
Following all these points, the subject of my end of studies project that took place in the Data Office
Department of Attijariwafa Bank is to avoid errors caused by automatic data processing
and to propose a transactional data visualization approach in order to facilitate the visual
detection of anomalies related.
